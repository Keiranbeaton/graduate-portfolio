      <p>
        I am a software developer specializing in full-stack Javascript, with experience writing HTML and CSS as well. I am currently located in Seattle, WA.
      </p>
      <p>
        I completed my bachelor's degree in Political Science at the University of Washington, Seattle Campus. I initially worked in sales out of college, but started learning to code in my spare time and enjoyed it so much I decided to switch career paths.

      <p>
        I am a graduate of the Advanced Software Development in Full-Stack Javascript course at <a href="https://www.codefellows.org/" class="about" target="_blank">Code Fellows</a>, where I was introduced to a number of different libraries and tools and learned to write clean, efficient code using best practices.
