      <p>
        I am a software developer, specializing in JavaScript, HTML and CSS. I am currently located in Seattle, WA.
      </p>
      <p>
        I completed my bachelor's degree in Political Science at the University of Washington, Seattle Campus. I initially worked in sales out of college, but started learning to code in my spare time and enjoyed it so much I decided to switch career paths.

      <p>
        I am a graduate of the Advanced Software Development in Full-Stack Javascript course at <a href="https://www.codefellows.org/" class="about" target="_blank">Code Fellows</a>, where I worked extensively with MEAN stack technologies, jQuery, Bootstrap, and other widely used libraries and frameworks.
